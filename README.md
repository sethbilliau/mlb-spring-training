# 2/28 Meeting TODOs
Figure out a way to grab challenged pitches 

We can ID pitches that end at-bats

For pitches that don't end at-bats: 
1. Scraping box scores

Sub-optimal methods
1. Crowd sourcing from reporter tweets, journalism?

To start: 
- Grab challenged pitches that end at-bats
- Qualifications: Ball to strike challenge that results in a strikeout, strike to ball challenge that results in a walk.

TODOs
- Creating graphics on challenged pitches
- Analyzing batters vs. (catchers/pitchers), challenged pitchers and universe of challenge-able pitchers
- Analyzing umpires
